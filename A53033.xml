         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <head>An Act for the Regulating Damages done in the time of the late Diſorders, and for the uniting the Minds of their Majeſties Subjects within this Province, and for calling home ſuch of their Majeſties Subjects that have lately abſented themſelves from their Habitations and the uſual places of their Abode.</head>
                     <p>FOraſmuch as many of their Majeſties Subjects have lately abſented themſelves from the uſual places of their Abode, and others, through cauſleſs fears, have alſo with-drawn themſelves out of this Province, by which means Trade is leſſened, the Strength of the Province is weakened, and their Families injured. And whereas it is highly neceſſary at this Juncture, being a time of War and great danger, that the Minds of the Subjects in this Province ſhould be heartily united. And foraſmuch as in the time of the late Diſorders, when <hi>Jacob Leyſler,</hi> lately attainted and executed, had uſurped a Power, and pretended a Government over their Majeſties Subjects within this Province, many Hurts, Injuries, Wrongs and Damages were done unto their Majeſties good and faithful Subjects by thoſe that were aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſiſting unto him in his uſurped Power and Government, as aforeſaid. And it being likewiſe neceſſary, that all their Majeſties Subjects, as aforeſaid, ſhould have ſome juſt and reaſonable Satisfaction from thoſe that have injured them; and that it is apparent that many through Ignorance and Fear, have been led aſide to do the Hurts and Harms, as aforeſaid, and if ſuch be proſecuted by the common Proceſs of the Law, may tend to the utter Ruin of them and their Families, and no wayes recompence the Injuries done, and thoſe that are moſt able to ſatisfie the Damages, and have been moſt active in proſecuting the ſame, eſcape free. And foraſmuch as the general Peace and Security of their Majeſties Government over this Province, cannot be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95123:20"/>firmer eſtabliſhed, than that all thoſe that have ſo abſented themſelves return again to their reſpective Abodes and Habitations, and that al their good Subjects heartily unite in the common Defence of the ſame againſt all Enemies whatſoever. And for the effectual doing thereof and that a juſt and equitable Satisfaction may be made to the Perſon injured, by thoſe that have been active, as aforeſaid, in ſuch equal and juſt Proportions, as the Circuſtances of the Fact will admit.</p>
